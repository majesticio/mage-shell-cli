# Mage shell CLI

## Overview

`mage.sh` is an `openai` compatible command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to enhance your terminal experience by providing quick and intuitive access to a powerful conversational AI. Inspired by the capabilities of modern AI, `mage.sh` allows users to interact with an AI assistant directly from their terminal, offering assistance with a wide range of topics and tasks.

Whether you need help understanding complex concepts, looking for coding assistance, or simply curious about what AI can do, `mage.sh` is your go-to terminal companion.

## Features

- **Conversational AI Interaction:** Engage in natural, conversational exchanges with an AI directly from your terminal.
- **Markdown Rendering:** Responses from the AI are rendered in Markdown, providing a rich text experience that includes formatting for improved readability.
- **Simple Installation:** Easy to install with minimal dependencies, getting you started in no time.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Designed to work seamlessly across various Unix-like operating systems.

## Prerequisites

Before installing `mage.sh`, ensure you have the following dependencies installed on your system:

- `curl`: For downloading files from the internet.
- `jq`: For processing JSON data.
- `glow`: For rendering Markdown content in the terminal.

## Installation

To install `mage.sh`, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/majesticio/mage-shell-cli/main/install.sh | sudo bash
```
This command fetches the installation script and executes it, handling all necessary setup steps to get `mage.sh` up and running on your system. You will now need to set the environment variables.

### Export your environment variables
Best if added to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file.

```sh
# Mage CLI Configuration

# Required Environment Variables
export MAGE_API_URL="http://<your-llm-server-ip>:11434/v1/chat/completions"
export MAGE_MODEL="mixtral"

# Optional Environment Variables
export MAGE_MAX_TOKENS=10000                  # Optional; defaults to 10000 if not set
export MAGE_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"        # Optional; replace with your actual API key
export MAGE_TEMPERATURE=0.7                    # Optional; omit if not needed
export MAGE_HISTORY_FILE="$HOME/.chat_history"  # Optional; defaults to ~/.chat_history if not set
export MAGE_SYSTEM_PROMPT="You are Mage, a specialized AI assistant for technical support."  # Optional
```

After adding to your bash or zsh profile restart the shell or use eg `source ~/.zshrc`

## Usage

After installation, you can start using `mage.sh` by typing `mage` in your terminal. This command launches the CLI interface, allowing you to begin interacting with the AI assistant.

Example usage:

```sh
mage
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to engage in a conversation with the AI. To exit, simply type `exit` or `quit`. A history of your chat is created at `~/.chat_history` which is loaded every time you run `mage`. Responses are rendered in markdown in your terminal.

## Customization

`mage.sh` is for a private api. I am using ollama so you can change the url for your own server.
